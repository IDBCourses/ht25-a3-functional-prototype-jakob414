1. Goal: Keep the square balanced at the top of the stick without letting it fall too far to the left or right.

2. Controls:
Left side keys:
D < small tilt left
S < medium tilt left
A < big tilt left

Right side keys:
J > small tilt right
K > medium tilt right
L > big tilt right

Press these keys to push the stick in the direction you want.

3. How it works
The square naturally wants to fall because of gravity.
Your key presses tilt it left or right to keep it balanced.
If the stick tilts too far, the game ends, and the game restarts.
The timer at the top shows how long you’ve survived

4. Winning
There isn’t a traditional “win”. The goal is to balance the stick for as long as possible.

5. Tips
Tap keys quickly and lightly, don’t hold them too long.
Small corrections are better than big ones.
Stay calm and focus on the middle!
